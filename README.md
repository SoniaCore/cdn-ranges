# CDN Ranges
Tool to download a list of IP ranges used by CDNs (Cloudflare, Akamai, Incapsula, Fastly, etc). This helps to avoid performing unnecessary port scans when doing bug bounties.

This uses publicly available lists of IP ranges, provided by most providers, and [BGPView](https://bgpview.io/) to query IP ranges for ASNs.

This was heavily inspired by [Project Discovery's cdncheck](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cdncheck).
